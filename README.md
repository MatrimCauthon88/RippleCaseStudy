## Overview and Origin 

According to the companyâ€™s webpage, Ripple was founded in 2012. (Source 1) However, that is not when the idea was formed. According to an article from medium.com in 2004, Ryan Fugger started developing a prototype focused on a decentralized credit network benefiting individuals interested in extending credit to friends and family. While Ryan Fugger was working on his project, which be later become RipplEPay.com, Jed McCaleb began working on a digital currency system in 2011 that, instead of mining, would gain consensus for transactions among members. McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and the two met with Ryan Fugger. The three agreed to team up and in 2012 founded OpenCoin, which lead to the development of ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment network. In 2013 OpenCoin become known as Ripple Labs, Inc. and later become known as Ripple. According to Forbes Arthur Britto is also considered a co-founder of Ripple.
