# Ripple Case Study


## Overview and Origin 

According to the company’s webpage, Ripple was founded in 2012. (Source 1) However, that is not when the idea was formed. According to an article from medium.com in 2004, Ryan Fugger started developing a prototype focused on a decentralized credit network benefiting individuals interested in extending credit to friends and family. While Ryan Fugger was working on his project, which be later become RipplEPay.com, Jed McCaleb began working on a digital currency system in 2011 that, instead of mining, would gain consensus for transactions among members. McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and the two met with Ryan Fugger. The three agreed to team up and in 2012 founded OpenCoin, which lead to the development of ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment network. In 2013 OpenCoin become known as Ripple Labs, Inc. and later become known as Ripple. According to Forbes Arthur Britto is also considered a co-founder of Ripple.

To date Ripple has received 294 Million dollars in funding. A February 2019 Forbes article shows that Ripple has received 94 Million dollars in funding. A December 2019 article on FinTechFutures.com shows Ripple reporting it has received an additional 200 Million dollars in its latest Series C funding round led by Tretagon and includes participation by SBI Holdings and Route 66 Ventures.

## Business Activities

Ripple looks to allow banks, individuals, companies, and institutions to move money across borders in fast, secure, cost-effective manner. The current process that banks and people use to move money around the world is based on the SWIFT network and can take up to 3-5 days for funds to move, provided all information is verified at every check point and costs 30 dollars or more per transaction. Failure to meet the verification process at any point under the SWIFT network causes delays and could potentially lead to loss of funds.

Ripple’s payment protocol uses an open-source, peer-to-peer decentralized platform. This allows for money to be exchanged between two parties globally. Ripple uses its own cryptocurrency, known as XRP, as the holding currency in the transaction between the two parties. The sending party’s currency is converted to XPR and then XPR is converted into the receiving party’s currency. This process takes 4 seconds to complete and in a much cheaper manner than the existing, traditional methods available.

Ripple is marketing itself to different financial institutions and money transfer services. According to the companies webpage, Ripple has over 300 financial institutions using RippleNet. This includes big names such as American Express, Bank of America, and Union Bank of Switzerland or UBS. Western Union and MoneyGram both announced in 2018 it begin testing the use of Ripple to transfer funds with Western Union using Ripple in pilot test and MoneyGram using Ripple’s xRapid and XPR in its pilot tests. Ripple is constantly looking to add other financial institutions to its growing lists of clients and business partners.

Ripple is currently using Blockchain technology along with its own protocol that is peer-to-peer and open sourced. Ripple uses these technologies in conjunction to allow for quick, cross-border, money transfers and transactions through its different services. Three of its services are known as xCurrent, xRapid, and xVia. xCurrent focuses on incoming payment processing, xRapid focuses on helping move funds between different currencies, and xVia focus on processing outgoing payments and transfers. These programs are disrupting the money transfer market by allowing for cheaper, quicker, and more secure transactions to take place globally.

## Landscape

Ripple falls into the domain of both Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. Though critics of Ripple claim they are not a true Cryptocurrency, claiming it is more of a security as it acts as a bridge in transactions and is not decentralized. Ripple defends its claim that it is a true Cryptocurrency by saying that its Cryptocurrency (XPR) can stand alone even if Ripple itself were to shut down. However, Ripple is not the only Cryptocurrency and Blockchain company out there. Stellar is another Blockchain company striving to leverage its own Cryptocurrency called XLM. Besides Stellar Forbes lists Bitfury, Circle, Coinbase, and Gemini as all being a Cryptocurrency and Blockchain company as well as being in the top 50 FinTech companies across all domains.
